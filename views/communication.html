    <h1 id="title">Navigating Privacy: Tesla's Approach to Personal Data in Fully Self-Driving Development</h1>
    <h2>by Dayn Reoh</h2>
    <div class="essay">
      <div class="row">
          <p>
            As more vehicle owners adopt Tesla's Fully Self-Driving<sup><a href="#e1">1</a></sup> (FSD) software, the company is leveraging an increasingly large collection 
            of data from its vehicle fleet<sup><a href="#e2">2</a></sup> to create a safer and more effective self-driving experience. However, many customers remain unaware 
            of the extent of personal and potentially invasive information collected by their vehicles for this advancement.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important for Tesla car owners to be informed about the specific personal data their vehicles are gathering, as this directly 
            enhances the performance of the FSD software. Almost all vehicle and Autopilot data collected from a Tesla car is unique to the owner, 
            encompassing detailed information about their driving patterns and preferences. This data is recorded in the gateway log file<sup><a href="#e3">3</a></sup> each time 
            the car is driven, and is retrieved by Tesla everytime the car connects to Wi-Fi.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Examples of personal information in Tesla’s collected data:<sup><a href="#e4">4</a></sup>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>Permanent vehicle location tracking: House, work, school, frequently visited areas, and charging stations.</li>
              <li>Pictures and videos of the environment surrounding the car: Garage, neighborhood, city buildings, and house.</li>
              <li>Driving tendencies: Vehicle speed, time-stamped usage, braking metrics, and component signaling.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Tesla claims to disassociate all vehicle data from the respective owners’ identity to anonymize data collection.<sup><a href="#e5">5</a></sup> 
            Everytime the car sends information, Tesla either replaces the Vehicle’s Identification Number (VIN) with a randomly generated 
            ID number or encrypts the data. These measures aim to remove a customer’s identity from their vehicle data.<sup><a href="#e6">6</a></sup> However, removing 
            the VIN does not disassociate frequently visited locations and their respective video recordings, allowing this information to 
            be linked together and traced back to the owner via data pattern matching.<sup><a href="#e7">7</a>, <a href="#e8">8</a></sup> Tesla employees reportedly shared sensitive customer 
            car recordings, undermining their claims of data anonymity and privacy.<sup><a href="#e9">9</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Tesla has curated the most diverse and accurate perception of the world’s driving landscape, leveraging the personalized information 
            collected from its extensive global vehicle fleet. As the number of Tesla cars on the road increases, so does the size and diversity of 
            their dataset, directly enhancing FSD performance improvement efforts. Without access to customer data, the driving landscape would be 
            far less representative, leading to an untrustworthy and error-prone product. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The FSD model improves each of its components through a data engine workflow.<sup><a href="#e10">10</a></sup> Tesla researchers analyze each component’s performance 
            using specific data collected from the vehicle fleet. When performance errors arise, researchers first diagnose and resolve these issues, 
            then integrate their solutions into the data engine. Each component learns from its previous mistakes, iteratively improving accuracy and 
            consistency as more data is collected.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Principal components of Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot software:<sup><a href="#e11">11</a></sup>
            <ol class="lists">
              <li>Object Detection: Uses video recordings from cameras and sensors around the car to detect surrounding objects in real 
                time. The precision of its detection is crucial for making safe and effective driving decisions. Tesla actively mines the 
                fleet data to identify and incorporate rare or unknown objects into the data engine.</li>
                <img class="image" src="../resources/img/object-detection.jpeg" alt="Tesla Object Detection">
              <li>Prediction: Allows the car to forecast actions and movements of objects surrounding it before they occur. Accurate 
                prediction of nearby road users' movements enhances driver safety. Tesla tracks incorrect predictions. A comprehensive 
                method evaluates the significance of an error and the extent of deviation between the prediction and result. Significant 
                deviations prompt human expert review for potential software issues.</li>
                <img class="image" src="../resources/img/prediction.jpeg" alt="Tesla Prediction">
              <li>Path Planning: Uses prediction and object detection information to make the safest and most pleasant driving decisions. 
                These decisions are made using imitation learning.<sup><a href="#e12">12</a></sup>
                <ul>
                  <li>Examples are: staying in the lane, following the speed limit, overtaking a car, making turns, and stopping at a light.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

          </p>
          <p>
            Waymo, another leading innovator in the self-driving car industry, differs from Tesla in its business model and scope. 
            Waymo's self-driving cars are used for ride-sharing services and are not available for individual ownership. They currently 
            only operate in Arizona, California, and Texas. Waymos’ smaller vehicle fleet<sup><a href="#e13">13</a></sup> and restricted operational areas limit its data 
            collection compared to Tesla.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Tesla’s advantages over Waymo: 
            <ol class="lists">
              <li>Their driving landscape and world perception is more diverse, complete, and high quality due to their data collection 
                practices.</li>
              <li>Tesla simulates<sup><a href="#e14">14</a></sup> a wide range of complex driving scenarios, each with unique challenges, to generate new training data, 
                while Waymo relies on data augmentation<sup><a href="#e15">15</a></sup> to create variations of their existing training data. </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Waymo provides more safety and transparency about its self-driving technology and data than Tesla, making them a 
            strong competitor and trustworthy company. Unlike Tesla, which rapidly extended its self-driving features worldwide, Waymo 
            is adopting a more cautious approach. They are developing high-quality self-driving functionality by focusing on perfecting 
            their technology in a few locations before expanding business globally. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Waymo’s advantages over Tesla: 
            <ol class="lists">
              <li>Their entire vehicle fleet dataset is open-sourced, providing transparency to, and receiving feedback from, 
                the public.<sup><a href="#e16">16</a></sup> </li>
              <li>Waymo uses three dimensions of vision for perception tracking around their car: Lidar,<sup><a href="#e17">17</a></sup> camera recordings, 
                and radar.<sup><a href="#e18">18</a></sup> Tesla only uses camera recordings.</li>
              <li>They simulate all self-driving functionality through environments that represent real world locations they operate in, 
                optimizing passenger safety.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Tesla holds a competitive edge in this market due to its expansive and diverse dataset, enabling its vehicles to 
            operate in a wide range of environments. However, this advantage comes with significant privacy concerns. Tesla's approach to 
            data collection raises questions about their ethical use of customer data, deteriorating customer trust. As Waymo expands 
            services beyond America, their commitment to transparency and safety could foster customer trust, giving them the ability to 
            shape the future of autonomous driving.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, Tesla's approach to data collection, while technologically beneficial, is dangerous. Their use of personal data 
            has accelerated their FSD capabilities, offering significant advantages to customers. However, Tesla’s careless handling of 
            customer data raises concerns about the ethical dimensions of their operations. Tesla now faces a critical juncture: to maintain 
            its leadership and reputation, it must not only continue innovating but also evolve its approach to data ethics. The future of 
            the self-driving car industry will likely be shaped by companies that can advance technologically while simultaneously building 
            and maintaining customer trust. As other companies gain access to similar volumes of data as Tesla, the competitive edge will 
            emerge from a balance of responsible data stewardship and safe technological advancement.
